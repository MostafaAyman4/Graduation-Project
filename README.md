# Self-Driving Car
We have achieved Level 3 on the automotive scale, having successfully passed the first four levels test stages:

Level 0: A pretty simple phase where we manually controlled the car using a mobile application.
Level 1: Implemented an anti-collision system using ultrasonic sensors System to monitor the surrounding environment.
Level 2: The car began to take control of its speed and direction autonomously, implementing lane assistance.
Level 3: The car can now drive itself entirely, determining its destination from the userâ€™s application and using built-in GPS for navigation. It processes a significant amount of data to drive autonomously.

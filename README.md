We have achieved Level 3 on the automotive scale, having successfully passed the first four levels test stages:
![IMG_7449](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10881f06-8d75-436d-bf8b-88bffbdf2615)

Level 0: A pretty simple phase where we manually controlled the car using a mobile application.
Level 1: Implemented an anti-collision using ultrasonic sensors System to monitor the surrounding environment.
Level 2: The car began to take control of its speed and direction autonomously, implementing lane assistance.
Level 3: The car can now drive itself entirely, determining its destination from the user’s application and using built-in GPS for navigation. It processes a significant amount of data to drive autonomously.

-I was responsible for these parts

    •	Project architecture
   
    •	All ARM (M3) cores connected together with CAN bus
   
       1.	Motion layer (back motors and steering system with PID controller)
       
       2.	Mapping layer (8 ultrasonic sensor runs 4 by 4 parallel)
       
       3.	Lidar layer (I transform 2D lidar to Work as 3D lidar by I mechanism and codes with equations)
       
    •	Main core (I write only the MCAL LAYER)
   
    •	Circuit diagram, PCB design and manufacturing with solder mask
   
    •	3D designing
